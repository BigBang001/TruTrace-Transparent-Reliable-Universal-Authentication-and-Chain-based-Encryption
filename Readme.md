# TruTrace: Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Verification System

## Project Overview
**TruTrace** is an innovative blockchain-powered platform designed to enhance the transparency and reliability of supply chains. This decentralized system leverages the power of blockchain technology to verify the authenticity and trace the origin of products from manufacturer to consumer. By providing a transparent, immutable record of transactions, **TruTrace** aims to combat fraud, improve accountability, and build trust across industries.

## Key Features
- **Transparency & Traceability**: Every transaction in the supply chain is recorded on a secure blockchain, ensuring transparency and traceability from production to delivery.
- **Authentication**: Using blockchain, we verify the authenticity of products, preventing counterfeiting and fraud.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated verification and process execution through smart contracts ensure efficiency and accuracy.
- **Real-time Tracking**: Users can track the movement of goods in real-time, ensuring complete visibility at every step of the supply chain.
- **Immutable Ledger**: Data stored on the blockchain cannot be tampered with, ensuring trust and security.

## Technologies Used
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, using Solidity for smart contracts to implement decentralized supply chain solutions.
- **Web3 Integration**: React.js for seamless front-end interactions and real-time data integration.
- **Smart Contracts**: Developed in Solidity for Ethereum, enabling the automation and security of transactions.
- **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for storing product data in a distributed manner.
- **Metamask**: For user authentication and interaction with the blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 14 or later)
- **Truffle** (for compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts)
- **Ganache** or any local blockchain environment (for testing contracts locally)
- **Metamask** (browser extension for interacting with Ethereum)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TruTrace.git
    cd TruTrace
    ```

2. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up the Ethereum network in **truffle-config.js**:
    - Configure your local Ethereum network (like Ganache), or a test network (Ropsten, Rinkeby).
    - Make sure to set up your Infura and mnemonic details if deploying to test networks.

4. Compile and migrate smart contracts:
    ```bash
    truffle compile
    truffle migrate --network development
    ```

5. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

6. Access the front-end interface at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How It Works
- **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain automatically verify product authenticity and facilitate transactions.
- **Blockchain**: The Ethereum blockchain is used to record each transaction made within the supply chain. These records are immutable, secure, and accessible in real time.
- **Front-End**: The front-end interface, built with React.js, connects to the blockchain through Web3.js, allowing users to interact with the system via MetaMask.

### Smart Contract Functions:
- **addProduct()**: Adds a product to the supply chain with its relevant information (ID, origin, batch number, etc.).
- **authenticateProduct()**: Verifies the authenticity of a product using blockchain data.
- **trackProduct()**: Allows users to track a product's movement through the supply chain.

## Future Plans
- **Multi-chain Support**: Integrate additional blockchains like Polkadot for cross-chain supply chain operations.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Implement advanced analytics for users to gain insights into their supply chain performance.
- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile app for easier access and real-time tracking.
